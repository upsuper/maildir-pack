               **** USACO CONTEST ANNOUNCEMENT *****

The November 2007 USACO Elite Competition starts shortly::

		http://contest.usaco.org

The Elite competition is *THREE HOURS* in length in total.

The competition is available through the end of Monday in most
timezones.

Read the rules at the contest site if you've never read them.

Results will probably be available by noon USA Mountain Time on
Thursday at:

        http://ace.delos.com/NOV07results

No special announcement about the results will be sent.

First-timers should consider doing the 'test' program from the USACO
training pages at

           http://train.usaco.org

(to reinforce I/O skills) before trying the real contest (really
-- this is not an idle suggestion).

Contest schedule:

   *  9-12 Nov, 2007 -- USACO November Contest
   *  7-11 Dec, 2007 -- USACO December Contest
   * 11-14 Jan, 2008 -- USACO January Contest
   *  8-11 Feb, 2008 -- USACO February Contest
   * 14-17 Mar, 2008 -- USACO March Contest
   * 24    Apr, 2008 -- US Open for USA and proctored international students
   * 25-28 Apr, 2008 -- US Open for all unproctored students
   * Early Jun, 2008 -- USA Invitational Competition (~8 days, by invitation)
   *       Aug, 2008 -- IOI, Mubarrak City, Egypt (by invitation)

Doing very well on an elite contest will earn an invitation to the
next higher division. Many students move up through the season.

Feel free to send your ID and ask for 'early grading' if you think
you will be moving up to the next division. I will not report your
score until the contest closes, however.
